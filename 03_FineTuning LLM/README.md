# Fine-Tuning AI for Yoda's Speech Style

This project fine-tunes a language model to generate text in Yoda's distinctive speech style using a pre-trained model. The project is implemented in a single Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file, which includes all steps, from model training to deployment.

## üß† Project Overview

- **Objective**: Fine-tuning a language model to mimic Yoda's unique speech patterns.
- **Tools**: Hugging Face Transformers, Gradio, OpenAI's API.
- **Deployment**: The notebook includes deployment code that uses Gradio to serve the model via a simple interface.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Project

You can run this project directly in a Jupyter Notebook environment like Google Colab or locally. Here's how:

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
First, install all the necessary dependencies by using the `requirements.txt` file.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt


## Step 2: Upload Your Model

Since the model is fine-tuned in the notebook, make sure you've uploaded the model's weights (e.g., `pytorch_model.bin`) and tokenizer files (e.g., `vocab.json`, `config.json`).

## Step 3: Run the Notebook

The notebook itself includes the full pipeline, from loading the pre-trained model to fine-tuning it on Yoda's speech style. Run the cells in the following order:

1. **Load Pre-trained Model**: The first section loads a pre-trained language model (such as GPT-2 or GPT-3) and its tokenizer.
2. **Fine-Tune Model**: The notebook demonstrates how the model is fine-tuned using a dataset of Yoda's speech patterns.
3. **Model Deployment**: At the end, the notebook sets up a Gradio interface to deploy the model and generate Yoda-like text in real-time.

## Step 4: Deploy and Test

Once the notebook is executed, it will deploy the model using Gradio, where you can input text and receive output in Yoda‚Äôs style.

## üî• Key Features

- **Fine-tuning**: The model is fine-tuned specifically on Yoda's dialogue from movies.
- **Real-time Interface**: A simple web-based interface to interact with the fine-tuned model.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluating the model using LLM-based judges to check if the generated text aligns with Yoda‚Äôs style.



## üöÄ Next Steps

- **Further Fine-Tuning**: You can extend this work by fine-tuning the model for other styles, such as Shakespearean or futuristic speech.
- **Evaluation**: Use LLM-based evaluators to continuously check how close the generated text is to Yoda's speech style.
- **Deployment**: Consider deploying the model to other platforms like Hugging Face Spaces or via API for broader use.
